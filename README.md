# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game supports a dynamic board size and uses Unicode characters to display the board in a visually appealing way.

## Features

- Dynamic board size (default is 3x3)
- Clear screen before each move for a clean display
- Smart input handling to ensure valid moves
- Check for winner or draw after each move
- Neat display using Unicode characters

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-python.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-python
    ```
3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    python tic_tac_toe.py
    ```

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty board.
2. Players take turns to enter their move.
3. Enter the number corresponding to the cell where you want to place your mark (X or O).
4. The game will display the updated board after each move.
5. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full (draw).
